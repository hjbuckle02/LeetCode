Breaking down the steps of this problem:

1. Take the input from the user. 
2. Have a dictionary of valid characters. 
3. Determine if the input is valid (meets the correct characters.)
4. Test to see if the first index is different from the second index.
5. Ensure the two are in the correct order with the corresponding character.
6. Determine as "false" else "true."

#The problem

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

#The explanation from redquark.org.

This is a simple question. We will traverse the string s from left to right and see if left and right parentheses are matching with their corresponding counterpart.

Traverse the string from left to right.
If we encounter the open/left parenthesis, then we will push it to the Stack data structure due to its Last In First Out (LIFO) property.
If we encounter any of the close/right parentheses, we will check it with the top of the stack. If it is the correct corresponding open/left parenthesis, we will move further, else we will return false.
At last, for valid string, the stack should be empty because all the left parentheses should have matched with the right ones.
Time Complexity
We are traversing the string once, hence the time complexity will be O(n).

Space Complexity
We are using Stack to store characters of the string, hence the space complexity will be O(n)

#To improve runtime:

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool: # The method isValid is designed to check if a string containing only the characters 
'(', ')', '{', '}', '[', and ']' is a valid sequence of balanced parentheses.
       
        d={')':'(',']':'[','}':'{'} #The dictionary d maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. 
        This allows easy lookup to check for matching pairs.
        st=[] #establishes the stack
        for i in s: #The method iterates over each character i in the string s.
            if i in d: #If the current character i is a closing bracket (i.e., it's in the dictionary d):
It checks if the stack st is not empty and if the top of the stack st[-1] is the corresponding opening bracket (d[i]). If so, it pops the top of the stack, indicating a matched pair.
If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket, it returns False, indicating an invalid sequence.
                if st and st[-1]==d[i]:
                    st.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                
                st.append(i)
        return True if not st else False
