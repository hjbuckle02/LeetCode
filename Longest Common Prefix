class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
'''
Breaking this down:

1. 'def' : This keyword is used to define a function or method in Python.
2. 'longestCommonPrefix' : This is the name of the method. It's customary to use descriptive methods to 
indicate what the method does. In this case, 'longestCommonPrefix suggests that the method will find
the longest common prefix among a list of strings.
3. 'self': In Python, 'self" is used in instance methods to refer the instance of the class on which the
method is being called. It allows access to the attributes and other methods of the class.
4. 'strs: List[str]': this specifies the parameter 'strs' that the method takes. The part after the method
takes. The part after the colon ('List[str]') is a type hint, indicating that 'strs' should be a list
of strings.
'List[str]' comes from the 'typing' module, which allows for type hinting in Python. It suggests that 
'strs" should be a list where each element is a string.
